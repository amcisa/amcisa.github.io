==================

Amcisa new web page, created with [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Cosmo theme from Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/cosmo/) and [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)

For new web developers:

###Prerequisite Knowledge

Some know-how of how HTML/CSS/JS works is needed to work on the project. 

1. Jade - A simple but powerful templating language that minimises the work needed to create a new web page.
2. Bootstrap - Provides plenty of ready-made Jquery plugins and beautiful CSS designs to start a page with.
3. Bootswatch - Beautiful bootstrap themes with different CSS customisations. 
4. BootstrapCDN - Content Delivery Network (CDN) for bootswatch theme packages.
5. Nodejs and npm - server-side javascript programming and package manager.

###Quick Set Up

1. [Install nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) on your local computer to get [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) up and running.
2. Install Jade by typing the following into your shell command line (not the nodejs command line). ```npm install -g jade```
3. Make sure that you have bootstrap.css or bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.js or bootstrap.min.js linked to your main jade file.
4. Further customisation to the CSS themes is done in the custom.css. You can use the "inspect element" provided by the browser to do instant preview of the change.
5. Please read through the [language reference for Jade](http://jade-lang.com/reference/) and the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) [reference](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) before you start so you know how to do modifications to the layout.
